# React - Football Statistics

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Main purpose for this App is to show information about Football league. App shows football results, fixtures, teams, team information and standings. This app is created for ReactJS and API exercises.

## Working Features

-   Shows results
-   Shows fixtures
-   Shows teams
-   Shows team information

## Features I'll be adding through time

-   More leagues
-   Select favourite team and see information about all games played in current season
-   Display all results in current season
-   Glass UI
-   Make light/dark mode

This is a plan for now but as I'll work on this project I believe I'll get more ideas which I'll be implementing. If you have any ideas, you are more than welcome to share them with me.
